# Scaleway LoadBalancer Annotations

For Scaleway LoadBalancers annotations are prefixed with `service.beta.kubernetes.io/`. For example:

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/scw-loadbalancer-forward-port-algorithm: "roundrobin"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/scw-loadbalancer-health-check-delay: "10s"
spec:
  ...
```

## Load balancer properties

You can get a list of working annotation on in the Scaleway loadBalancer [documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/) annotations are:

Note:
- If an invalid mode is passed in the annotation, the service will throw an error.
 If an annotation is not specified, the cloud controller manager will apply default configuration.

### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/scw-loadbalancer-id`

The possible format are:
 - `<certificate-id>`: will use this certificate for all frontends
 - `<certificate-id>,<certificate-id>` will use these certificates for all frontends
 - `<port1>:<certificate1-id>,<certificate2-id>;<port2>,<port3>:<certificate3-id>` will use certificate 1 and 2 for frontend with port port1 and certificate3 for frotend with port port2 and port3

### `service.beta.kubernetes.io/scw-loadbalancer-target-node-labels`
